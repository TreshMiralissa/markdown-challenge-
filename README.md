#### The old spooky and scary house of my friends 
I was in the (old) house of my friends to prepare a Halloween party. It was quite a spooky house and full of strange noises. I went upstairs to get something. I heard footsteps on the staircase and my fiancé came out of nowhere. I screamed, scaring him back.

##### TL;DR Almost gave my fiancé and I a heart attack for nothing
